        Police violence refers to 
        the use of excessive or unnecessary 
        force by law enforcement officers against civilians, 
        often resulting in injury or death. This type of violence 
        can take many forms, including physical assault, harassment, 
        verbal abuse, and use of lethal force such as firearms, 
        stun guns, or other weapons. 
        It can also include systemic and 
        institutionalized forms of violence, 
        such as discriminatory policing practices, 
        racial profiling, and other forms of police misconduct. 
        Police violence can have serious consequences for the victims, 
        their families, and the broader community, 
        and it can erode public trust in law enforcement and the justice system.
